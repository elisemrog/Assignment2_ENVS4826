# Introduction

Salt marshes are known for their ability to store carbon. The carbon stored in these types of ecosystems is called "blue carbon". Plants on the salt marsh have the ability to add to the carbon that is already stored within the marsh. The allochthonous carbon is present due to consistent tidal flooding. Salt marsh soils can store more organic carbon at a very fast rate compared to forest and agricultural soils. Salt marshes are a very valuable resource. 

In the past, dyking has caused a great loss of salt marshes and the organic carbon they have the ability to store. This is why restoring salt marshes can help lower the concentrations of atmospheric CO2. As the threat of climate change and sea level rise continues to grow, policy makers are starting to turn away from hard infrastructure as coastal protection and pay more attention to managed realignment (MR). MR allows for the regrowth of intertidal ecosystems such as salt marshes. 

In Eastern Canada, very few studies have tried to determine the rates of carbon accumulation in recovering marshes on a short time scale. In this study, two dyke breaches were performed and the rates of carbon storage and sediment accumulation in the newly recovering marsh were observed.

## Methods

To perform this study, one section of the Aulac dykelands in the Bay of Fundy, was breached. The restoration site is made up of two marsh cells, with a tidal gate separating them. Cell A is larger than cell B, and cell B is divided by a channel. In 2012, salt marsh cordgrass was first observed growing in both cells. When it was time to sample during the summer of 2016, salt marsh cordgrass had grown across the restored marsh, but there was still some exposed mud. Most of cell A was completely covered, (there were minimal areas of bare mud). The northern part of cell B was not vegetated whereas the southern part of the cell is almost completely covered. 

To complete this study successfully, the elevation of the ground in each cell was measured before the dyke was breached in 2010. After the breach, elevations were measured annually at 50 different locations on the restoring marsh. Sediment deposition was estimated by determining the differences in elevation from one year to the next. Sediment samples were taken using corers, which were to be analyzed for carbon content, by using a loss on ignition method (LOI). The LOI method consists of weighing the sediment sample, then burning it for 1 hour at 350  ̊C, and then for 4 hours at 550 ̊, then weighing it again to determine the difference in weight. This will indicate the organic matter content, which can be converted to the carbon content by using the following equation: [Organic C fraction = 0.40(LOI fraction) + (0.025 LOI fraction)]. 

The statistical analyses were completed using IBM SPSS Statistics v22. To determine the differences in sediment carbon density between areas with and without vegetation, independent t-tests were used.

### Results and Conclusion

The annual elevation surveys show that 37% of the deposition occurring after managed realignment was in the first year. They were also able to determine that the mean carbon density in each core that was taken did not vary much over the marsh, regardless of the length or depth of the core, as seen in Figure 1. There is no correlation between the depth at which the sediment core was taken and the carbon density. Independent t-tests also determined that there are no significant differences between the carbon density in cores collected in vegetated versus non-vegetated areas or in samples collected at 0-30 cm depth or from >30 cm depth. The carbon density was mostly the same across the marsh surface, so the depth of the sediment was the major factor to determine how much carbon would be located in one area. 

The data shows that over the 6 years of monitoring, most of the accumulated carbon comes from sediment deposition, brought in by regular tides. As this newly restored marsh matures, it is likely that the high rates of carbon accumulation will decrease, and that the rates lower and become more similar to the other mature marshes in the area. It was determined that although the presence of vegetation does not seem to have any direct effect on increasing the density of carbon in the soil, vegetation does not effectively trap sediment and therefore increases carbon storage through the accumulation of sediment.

This study determined that carbon storage and sediment deposition can occur very quickly in the Bay of Fundy after managed realignment. It also shows that the rates of carbon burial in new, recovering marshes are much higher than mature marshes.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
